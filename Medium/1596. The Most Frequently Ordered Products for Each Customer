Write a solution to find the most frequently ordered product(s) for each customer.
The result table should have the product_id and product_name for each customer_id who ordered at least one order.

Return the result table in any order. The result format is in the following example.

# calculate order_number for each product of each customer
WITH order_number AS(
    SELECT c.customer_id,
       o.product_id,
       count(o.order_id) AS order_number
    FROM Customers c
    LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
    LEFT JOIN Products p ON p.product_id = o.product_id
    WHERE o.order_id IS NOT NULL AND p.product_id IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY c.customer_id, o.product_id
),

# find order_rank for each customer
order_rank AS(
    SELECT customer_id,
       product_id,
       order_number,
       dense_rank() OVER(Partition by customer_id Order by order_number DESC) as order_rank
    FROM order_number
)

SELECT cte.customer_id,
       cte.product_id,
       p.product_name
FROM order_rank cte
LEFT JOIN Products p ON cte.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE cte.order_rank = 1
ORDER BY 1 ASC;
