Table: Customers

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| customer_id   | int     |
| customer_name | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
customer_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name and the id customer.
 

Write a solution to find the missing customer IDs. The missing IDs are ones that are not in the Customers table but are in the range between 1 and the maximum customer_id present in the table.
Notice that the maximum customer_id will not exceed 100.

Return the result table ordered by ids in ascending order.
The result format is in the following example.


Example 1:

Input: 
Customers table:
+-------------+---------------+
| customer_id | customer_name |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | Alice         |
| 4           | Bob           |
| 5           | Charlie       |
+-------------+---------------+
Output: 
+-----+
| ids |
+-----+
| 2   |
| 3   |
+-----+
Explanation: 
The maximum customer_id present in the table is 5, so in the range [1,5], IDs 2 and 3 are missing from the table.


## Solution:
WITH RECURSIVE numbers AS (
    SELECT 1 AS id
    UNION ALL
    SELECT id+1
    FROM numbers
    WHERE id < (
        # find the maximum custmer id
        SELECT max(customer_id)
        FROM Customers
    )
),

match_table AS(
    SELECT *
    FROM numbers
)

# find missing numbers
SELECT id AS ids
FROM match_table
WHERE id NOT IN(
    SELECT customer_id
    FROM Customers
)
ORDER BY 1 ASC;
