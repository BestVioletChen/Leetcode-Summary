## 3166. Calculate Parking Fees and Duration

The table name is ParkingTransactions and it has five columns
+--------------+-----------+
| Column Name  | Type      |
+--------------+-----------+
| lot_id       | int       |
| car_id       | int       |
| entry_time   | datetime  |
| exit_time    | datetime  |
| fee_paid     | decimal   |
+--------------+-----------+

(lot_id, car_id, entry_time) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID of the parking lot, the ID of the car, the entry and exit times, and the fee paid for the parking duration.
Write a solution to find the total parking fee paid by each car across all parking lots, and the average hourly fee (rounded to 2 decimal places) paid by each car. Also, find the parking lot where each car spent the most total time.

Return the result table ordered by car_id in ascending order.

Note: Test cases are generated in such a way that an individual car cannot be in multiple parking lots at the same time.

Solution:

WITH lot_most_time AS (
    SELECT 
        car_id, 
        lot_id, 
        SUM(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, entry_time, exit_time)) AS total_time  # remember to change time format
    FROM 
        ParkingTransactions
    GROUP BY 
        car_id, lot_id # cannot only group by car_id
),

car_most_time AS (
    SELECT 
        car_id, 
        lot_id AS most_time_lot
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            car_id, 
            lot_id, 
            total_time,
            RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY car_id ORDER BY total_time DESC) AS time_rank
        FROM 
            lot_most_time
    ) AS ranked_lots
    WHERE 
        time_rank = 1
),
total_parking_fee AS (
    SELECT 
        car_id, 
        SUM(fee_paid) AS total_fee_paid,
        ROUND(SUM(fee_paid) / (SUM(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, entry_time, exit_time)) / 60), 2) AS avg_hourly_fee
    FROM 
        ParkingTransactions
    GROUP BY 
        car_id
)
SELECT 
    tpf.car_id, 
    tpf.total_fee_paid, 
    tpf.avg_hourly_fee, 
    cmt.most_time_lot
FROM 
    total_parking_fee tpf
JOIN 
    car_most_time cmt ON tpf.car_id = cmt.car_id
ORDER BY 
    tpf.car_id ASC;
